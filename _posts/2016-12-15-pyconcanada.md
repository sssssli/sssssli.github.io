title: Pycon Canada 2016
---
Earlier in November this year, I had the opportunity to help run a tutorial at [PyCon Canada](https://2016.pycon.ca), which is the Canadian version of [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2017/). PyCon is a gathering of the Python community, and filled with talks, tutorials and sprints. Unlike PyData, where there's a data focus, PyCon is much more diverse.

The tutorial was led by [Sourabh Mittal](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/sourabh-mittal-9b55537) and one of the six tutorials presented at PyCon Canada this year, and it was the only one that was sponsored (by our employer Capital One). The focus on the tutorial was building a web application that does optical character recognition (OCR) in the backend. Main technical specs were Flask (Python package) and Tesseract (OCR package written in C++).

Unfortunately, PyCon Canada does not video tape the tutorials, however, here is our [repo](https://github.com/srbhmitt/pycon-tutorial) if you want to want to check it out yourself!
