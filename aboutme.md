title: About me
subtitle: Why you'd want to read my stuff
---

I'm a data scientist and I really like data. I like designing experiments to collect data, looking and analyzing data, and using data to draw insights, in hopes to make an impact on the world.

During my younger days, I've enjoyed publishing, particularly in the form of sharing knowledge (see below for a list). For someone with a relatively poor memory, anything that's not written down will be inevitably forgotten. I started this personal collection of **mostly** technical stuff, hoping that it would force me to clean and publish my code on the internet, such that they can help someone else one day.
